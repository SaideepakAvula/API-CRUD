📋 Project Overview

This API serves as a simple backend for managing product data, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete product entries. It’s designed as a foundational project to understand RESTful services using Node.js and Express.js, and how to interact with MongoDB for data storage and management.

🏗️ Architecture

Express.js handles routing and HTTP requests.
MongoDB serves as the database, storing product details.
Mongoose is used to define data schemas and interact with MongoDB in an object-oriented way.
